        * CairoPlot.py: Merged Magnun's branch. Series, Group and Data 
        		 input formats are now available.

        * CairoPlot.py: Color themes now work correctly for backgrounds.
        		 besides allowing the user to change the background
        		 color using strings, it's also possible to define
        		 gradients using a string of colors like "red white"
        		 which would create a red-to-white gradient.
        		 Furthermore, background=None now implies on
        		 transparent backgrounds;
        		Value labels above the bars are now possible through
        		 the display_values attribute;
        		The series_labels parameter is now enabled for BarPlot
        		 charts. Whenever it's present, a legend box is
        		 plotted on the right upper corner.

2009-03-09  Rodrigo Araújo <alf.rodrigo@gmail.com>
        * CairoPlot.py: BarPlot, HorizontalBarPlot and VerticalBarPlot revision
        		 and refactoring;
        		Color themes are now allowed for backgrounds.

2009-03-08  Rodrigo Araújo <alf.rodrigo@gmail.com>
        * CairoPlot.py: Code revision and refactoring;
        		The BarPlot class is now a base class on top of which
        		 the classes HorizontalBarPlot and VerticalBarPlot are
        		 built	
        		Color themes are now available;
        		PiePlot and DonutPlot data is now ordered;
        		Horizontal label collision problem was solved for
        		 BarPlots;
        		Axis titles are now allowed for ScatterPlot, DotLinePlot
        		 and FunctionPlot classes.
        * tests.py: 	Theme tests were added;
        		BarPlot tests were changed into HorizontalBarPlot 
        		and VerticalBarPlot tests.

2009-01-30  Rodrigo Araújo <alf.rodrigo@gmail.com>
        * CairoPlot.py: Class structure was refactored as it was noted that
        		the new ScatterPlot was able to render DotLine and 
        		FunctionPlots;
        		Following the refactoring, the bounds associated with
        		a FunctionPlot chart (x_bounds) now define a closed
        		interval, which means the last value is also taken
        		taken into account;
        		Error bars support was added to the ScatterPlot;
        		All h_* and v_* parameters have been changed to x_*
        		and y_*.
        * tests.py: 	FunctionPlot tests were changed to fit the new bounds;
        		All tests were changed to reflect the h_* and v_* to 
        		x_* and y_* parameter change.
